# TinyApp Project
By Dino Pranjic

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). 

Users can create accounts and create short URLs. Only verified users can view and edit URLs. I added some personal touches to this project such as a custom error page.
